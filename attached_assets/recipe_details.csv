If your turkey has any giblets inside, remove and discard or use to make stock. Pat the skin dry with kitchen paper.; Place the halved shallot and 1 bay leaf inside the main cavity of the bird, then tie the turkey legs together with kitchen string (it's best to use wet string to prevent it burning in the oven).; Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Melt 25g butter in a large frying pan, add the shallots and cook over a low heat for 10 mins or until very soft, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Blitz the bread to fine breadcrumbs in a food processor. Then add the cranberries, sage, chestnuts, sausagemeat, breadcrumbs, half of the orange zest and a generous grating of nutmeg to the bowl. Season and mix well to combine.; When you're ready to stuff the turkey, place it on a large clean board and preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Add the remaining orange zest and another grating of nutmeg to the remaining butter in a bowl and mix well. Using your fingers, gently ease the skin away from the turkey breast, being careful not to rip the skin. Carefully spread the softened butter mixture under the skin and over the breast to thinly cover it.; Place about 300g of the stuffing mixture inside the neck cavity, then turn the turkey over so that it's breast-side down, pull the neck skin flap down over the stuffing to encase it and secure with cocktail sticks or skewers.; Weigh the stuffed turkey to calculate the cooking time based on 20 mins per kg, plus 105 mins. A stuffed 5kg bird should weigh about 5.3kg so should take around 3½ hrs in the oven.; Arrange the celery in the base of a large roasting tin to make a trivet for the bird to sit on, and add the remaining bay leaf. Place the turkey on top of the celery trivet. Loosely cover with lightly buttered foil. Cook in the oven for the calculated time, basting with the juices after the first hour and thereafter, every 45 mins. Remove the foil for the final 40-45 mins to allow the skin to turn golden and crisp – do keep an eye on it so it doesn't darken too much.; Meanwhile, shape the remaining stuffing into 12 equal balls, wrapping each in a slice of pancetta and tucking in a sage leaf. Cover and chill until ready to cook.; To check whether the turkey is cooked through, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest parts of the leg and breast, avoiding the bone. If it reads 75°C or above, it's cooked. Alternatively, insert a metal skewer in the same way and check the juices run clear. If they're pink or the temperature is below 75°C, roast for 15 mins more, then retest.; Transfer the bird to a carving board or warmed serving platter, cover loosely with large sheets of foil and clean tea towels. Rest for at least 30 mins (or up to 1½ hrs). While the turkey rests, cook the stuffing balls for 25-30 mins or until cooked through.; To make the gravy, scoop out the celery and transfer to a medium pan and set aside. Tip the meat juices from the roasting tin into a large jug, allow to settle, then skim off and discard any excess fat. You should have about 400ml of meat juices, don't worry if you have less, you can just top up with extra stock.; Put the roasting tin over a medium-high heat on the hob. When hot, add the sherry to deglaze the tin – scraping the base of the tin with a wooden spoon to loosen any meaty bits stuck to it. Carefully pour this mixture into the pan with the celery, along with the meat juices, the redcurrant jelly, 800ml chicken stock and the bay leaf (if you had less than 400ml meat juices, then add extra stock here). Slowly bring to the boil, then boil rapidly for 10 mins until beginning to reduce. Season to taste adding a little more redcurrant jelly if needed – you can also add a squeeze of lemon juice here if you like.; Strain through a sieve and return to the pan. Off the heat, gradually stir the cornflour mixture into the gravy until thickened. If it’s still too thin, repeat with 1 tbsp cornflour dissolved in 1 tbsp cold water until the gravy reaches a velvety, pourable thickness. Keep warm over a low heat (but don’t let it boil) until ready to serve.; Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy, stuffing balls and your favourite festive vegetable sides",

It is important that you do not cut the pieces too small – the meat is going to be braised until tender, and smaller pieces may break up.; Heat a dash of vegetable oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Cook the meat and pancetta in the pan until browned. Pour in the vinegar and stir well for 1-2 minutes. Take the pan off the heat.; Place a knob of butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the leek, celery and carrots once the butter has melted. Cook until the vegetables are golden brown and soft. Take the pan off the heat.; Repeat the process in a separate pan with the sliced onion, star anise and butter. In another pan, cook the mushrooms in the same way along with a knob of butter. You’ll end up using a lot of pans, so you may have to rope the little ones in when it comes to washing up!; Preheat the oven to gas 8, 220°C, fan 200°C.; Cut the tomato in half and place in a bowl with the caster sugar. Toss to coat the tomatoes and then arrange them cut-side down on a baking tray. Drizzle some olive oil over the top.; Place the tomatoes in the oven and cook until caramelised and tender – this takes around 20 minutes.; Place the caramelised vegetables, the meat, pancetta and tomatoes in a flameproof casserole dish. Add the bouquet garni and pour in enough stock to cover the ingredients. Leave to simmer for 2 1/2 hours.; Strain the sauce into a separate pan once the meat has become tender. Place the sauce back on the hob and continue simmering until it reduces and has a thin, gravy-like consistency.; Place the solids back in the pan of sauce and take the pan off the heat.; Add a knob of butter to a frying pan over a medium heat. Cook the baby onions (or shallots) until they become brown. Take them out and leave aside.; Heat another knob of butter in the same pan. Fry the button mushrooms until browned, and then mix the baby onions and mushrooms into the beef stew.; Begin making the dumplings by mixing the plain flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Place the suet in the bowl and add enough water to bind the mixture.; Get your little ones to roll the dough between their hands to form small dumplings – they should be around the size of cherry tomatoes. You should end up with 16 dumplings.; Heat lightly salted water in a large pan. Once it is simmering, add the dumplings and place a lid on the pan. Poach the dumplings for 15-20 minutes.; Place the stew back on the stove and reheat.; To serve, divide the stew between bowls.

Cut the pastry down the length into 2 equal strips. Take half the sausage meat and using your hands, roll to make a sausage shape that is the same length as the pastry. Put the sausage meat down the middle of the pastry strip lengthways.; Brush beaten egg down one side of the pastry and on the sausage meat, fold the other side of the pastry over the meat first and then the side with beaten egg. Gently run your hands up and down the length of the sausage roll to ensure it is compact and straight. Repeat with the remaining pastry and sausage meat so you have 2 long sausage rolls. Cut each one into 6 or 12 even pieces and put on a lined baking tray and brush the tops with beaten egg.

Place the flour, salt, sugar and yeast into a large bowl and mix together. Then whisk together the warm milk, egg and almond extract and gradually add and stir until you have a smooth, slightly sticky dough. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes dusting with more flour as necessary until the dough is smooth and the surface is slightly springy to touch and not sticky. Place into a lightly oiled bowl and cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. On a lightly floured board, roll out into a 5mm thick rectangle about 30cm x 40cm with the shorter side facing you. Place the butter onto a board and bash with a rolling pin until it is approx. 26cm wide, 10cm in length and 1cm deep. Place in the middle of the dough and make sure there is a 2cm border. Leave a 1cm border at the sides clear of butter, so that it doesn’t spill from the sides of the pastry during rolling

.; Fold the butter-free part of the dough over the middle third, then fold the remaining, unbuttered third over to make a flat parcel (like folding a letter into 3 to put inside an envelope). Lightly press down the open ends to seal, then chill, covered in cling film, for 15 minutes. Remove the cling film and lay the dough on a floured surface with the short side facing you. Roll out in one direction. You’ll get a very long rectangle – don’t worry as the next time you roll the dough it will be a more manageable size. As before, fold the bottom third of pastry over the middle third, then fold the top third over. Wrap in cling film and chill for 15 minutes more. Repeat the rolling and folding process 1 more time, but this time start the dough on the floured surface with the longest side facing you. Allow the dough to rest in the fridge for another 15 minutes.; Repeat steps 5 and 6, so you’ve rolled the dough into a long rectangle 4 times. Wrap the dough with cling film and chill overnight until firm. Trim the edges; the dough is now ready to make Almond custard Danish pastries or croissants. Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with nonstick baking paper. Roll out the pastry to a 5mm thickness and cut into 12 x 10cm squares. Place a generous tablespoon of custard into the middle, then brush the edges of pastry with beaten egg and fold the pastry corners into the centre to enclose the filling. Place the pastries on a lined baking sheet.; Chill, covered in cling film, for 20 minutes. Brush each pastry with the beaten egg, scatter with flaked almonds and bake for 15-18 minutes or until puffed up and until golden brown. Meanwhile, whisk the icing sugar, milk and almond extract together in a small bowl until it forms a thick but pourable icing and set aside. Cool the pastries for 5-10 minutes, drizzle with the icing and serve.

Transfer to lined baking sheets, then return to the fridge for 20 mins. Reroll the offcuts and repeat to stamp out more biscuits; you should end up with approximately 52 rounds. Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C.; Bake the biscuits in batches for 8-9 mins until dry and very pale golden. Leave to cool on the sheets for 5 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.; Meanwhile, put the dates in a heatproof bowl and pour over boiling water to cover. Leave to soak for 15 mins, then drain, reserving a mug of the water. Use a blender to blitz the dates with 5-6 tbsp reserved water, as needed, to make a smooth, spreadable paste.; Dust the icing sugar over the biscuits with the snowflakes cut out. Spread date jam onto each non-dusted biscuit, leaving a small border around the edge, then sandwich with the dusted biscuits. Will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container, though best eaten on the day they’re made.",
